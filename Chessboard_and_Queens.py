# Your task is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no
# two queens are attacking each other. As an additional challenge,
# each square is either free or reserved, and you can only place
# queens on the free squares. However, the reserved squares do not
# prevent queens from attacking each other.

# How many possible ways are there to place the queens?
